# CARS-live-dashboard

This is the code for a live dashboard on the number of responses to the Coding in Analysis and Research survey, broken down by department.

To build, set the working directory to the location of live_dashboard.Rmd and run the following command in RStudio:
  rmarkdown::render_site()
  
The data should be placed in a folder named CARS-data/ two folders up relative to the location of live_dashboard.Rmd.
